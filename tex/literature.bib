abstract = {We study the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem for sets of points or balls in high
dimensions. Using techniques of second-order cone programming and "core-sets", we
have developed (1 + ε)-approximation algorithms that perform well in practice, especially
for very high dimensions, in addition to having provable guarantees. We prove the
existence of core-sets of size O(1/ε), improving the previous bound of O(1/ε2), and
we study empirically how the core-set size grows with dimension. We show that our
algorithm, which is simple to implement, results in fast computation of nearly optimal
solutions for point sets in much higher dimension than previously computable using
exact techniques.},

abstract = {Given ${cal A} := {a^1,dots,a^m} subset mathbb{R}^n$ and $epsilon > 0$, we
propose and analyze two algorithms for the problem of computing a $(1 + epsilon)$-approximation
to the radius of the minimum enclosing ball of ${cal A}$. The first algorithm is
closely related to the Frank-Wolfe algorithm with a proper initialization applied
to the dual formulation of the minimum enclosing ball problem. We establish that this
algorithm converges in $O(1/epsilon)$ iterations with an overall complexity bound
of $O(mn/epsilon)$ arithmetic operations. In addition, the algorithm returns a “core
set” of size $O(1/epsilon)$, which is independent of both $m$ and $n$. The latter
algorithm is obtained by incorporating “away” steps into the former one at each iteration
and achieves the same asymptotic complexity bound as the first one. While the asymptotic
bound on the size of the core set returned by the second algorithm also remains the
same as the first one, the latter algorithm has the potential to compute even smaller
core sets in practice, since, in contrast to the former one, it allows “dropping”
points from the working core set at each iteration. Our analysis reveals that the
leading terms in the asymptotic complexity analysis are reasonably small. In contrast
to the first algorithm, we also establish that the second algorithm asymptotically
exhibits linear convergence, which provides further insight into our computational
results, indicating that the latter algorithm indeed terminates faster with smaller
core sets in comparison with the first one. We also discuss how our algorithms can
be extended to compute an approximation to the minimum enclosing ball of more general
input sets without sacrificing the iteration complexity and the bound on the core
set size. In particular, we establish the existence of a core set of size $O(1/epsilon)$
for a much wider class of input sets. We adopt the real number model of computation
in our analysis.},

 abstract = {In the classical linear programming problem the behaviour of continuous, nonnegative variables subject to a system of linear inequalities is investigated. One possible generalization of this problem is to relax the continuity condition the variables. This paper presents a simple numerical algorithm for the solution of programming problems in which some or all of the variables can take only discrete values. The algorithm requires no special techniques beyond these used in ordinary linear programming, and lends itself to automatic computing. Its use is illustrated on two numerical examples.},

set of points, so that using those core-sets enable us to perform approximate clustering
efficiently. The surprising property of those core-sets is that their size is independent
of the dimension.Using those, we present a (1+ ε)-approximation algorithms for the
k-center clustering and k-median clustering problems in Euclidean space. The running
time of the new algorithms has linear or near linear dependency on the number of points
and the dimension, and exponential dependency on 1/ε and k. As such, our results are
a substantial improvement over what was previously known.We also present some other
clustering results including (1+ ε)-approximate 1-cylinder clustering, and k-center
clustering with outliers.},

In the case of a fixed dimension, the problem is polynomial-time solvable but in general, when d is not fixed, the complexity status is not known. We prove the strong NP-hardness in the case of Euclidean space and the (2−ε)-inapproximability in the case of L∞ metric. We also present a simple 2-approximation algorithm for any metric, and PTAS for L∞-space of dimension O(logn).}

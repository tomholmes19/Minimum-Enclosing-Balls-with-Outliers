abstract = {We study the minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem for sets of points or balls in high
dimensions. Using techniques of second-order cone programming and "core-sets", we
have developed (1 + ε)-approximation algorithms that perform well in practice, especially
for very high dimensions, in addition to having provable guarantees. We prove the
existence of core-sets of size O(1/ε), improving the previous bound of O(1/ε2), and
we study empirically how the core-set size grows with dimension. We show that our
algorithm, which is simple to implement, results in fast computation of nearly optimal
solutions for point sets in much higher dimension than previously computable using
exact techniques.},
